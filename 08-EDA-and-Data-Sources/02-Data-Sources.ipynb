    "# Data Sources\n",
    "This notebook formally introduces the variety of other data sources that you can use with Spark out of the box as well as the countless other sources built by the greater community. Spark has six “core” data sources and hundreds of external data sources written by the community. The ability to read and write from all different kinds of data sources and for the community to create its own contributions is arguably one of Spark’s greatest strengths. Following are Spark’s core data sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* CSV\n",
    "* JSON\n",
    "* Parquet\n",
    "* ORC\n",
    "* JDBC/ODBC connections\n",
    "* Plain-text files\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, Spark has numerous community-created data sources. Here’s just a small sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "* BigQuery\n",
    "* Cassandra\n",
    "* HBase\n",
    "* MongoDB\n",
    "* AWS Redshift\n",
    "* XML\n",
    "* And many, many others\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to give you the ability to read and write from Spark’s core data sources and know enough to understand what you should look for when integrating with third-party data sources. To achieve this, we will focus on the core concepts that you need to be able to recognize and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Structure of the Data Sources API\n",
    "Before proceeding with how to read and write from certain formats, let’s visit the overall organizational structure of the data source APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Read API Structure\n",
    "The core structure for reading data is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "DataFrameReader.format(...).option(\"key\", \"value\").schema(...).load()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use this format to read from all of our data sources. format is optional because by default Spark will use the Parquet format. option allows you to set key-value configurations to parameterize how you will read data. Lastly, schema is optional if the data source provides a schema or if you intend to use schema inference. Naturally, there are some required options for each format, which we will discuss when we look at each format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics of Reading Data\n",
    "The foundation for reading data in Spark is the DataFrameReader. We access this through the SparkSession via the read attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "spark.read\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have a DataFrame reader, we specify several values:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The format\n",
    "* The schema\n",
    "* The read mode\n",
    "* A series of options\n",
    "\n",
    "The format, options, and schema each return a DataFrameReader that can undergo further transformations and are all optional, except for one option. Each data source has a specific set of options that determine how the data is read into Spark (we cover these options shortly). At a minimum, you must supply the DataFrameReader a path to from which to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of the overall layout:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "spark.read.format(\"csv\")\\\n",
    "  .option(\"mode\", \"FAILFAST\")\\\n",
    "  .option(\"inferSchema\", \"true\")\\\n",
    "  .option(\"path\", \"path/to/file(s)\")\\\n",
    "  .load()\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "As we have seen before we can put the \"path\" option directly in the `load()` method, i.e.: `.load(\"path/to/file(s)\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "**READ MODES**\n",
    "Reading data from an external source naturally entails encountering malformed data, especially when working with only semi-structured data sources. Read modes specify what will happen when Spark does come across malformed records. Table below lists the read modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|Read mode | Description |\n",
    "| -- | -- |\n",
    "| permissive | Sets all fields to null when it encounters a corrupted record and places all corrupted records in a string column called \\_corrupt_record |\n",
    "| dropMalformed | Drops the row that contains malformed records |\n",
    "| failFast | Fails immediately upon encountering malformed records |\n",
    "\n",
    "The default is *permissive*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Let's load a sample CSV file, similar to what we have seen before:"

CSV files, while seeming well structured, are actually one of the trickiest file formats you will encounter because not many assumptions can be made in production scenarios about what they contain or how they are structured. For this reason, the CSV reader has a large number of options. These options give you the ability to work around issues like certain characters needing to be escaped—for example, commas inside of columns when the file is also comma-delimited or null values labeled in an unconventional way.\n",

It provides columnar compression, which saves storage space and allows for reading individual columns instead of entire files. It is a file format that works exceptionally well with Apache Spark and is in fact the default file format. We recommend writing data out to Parquet for long-term storage because reading from a Parquet file will always be more efficient than JSON or CSV. Another advantage of Parquet is that it supports complex types. This means that if your column is an array (which would fail with a CSV file, for example), map, or struct, you’ll still be able to read and write that file without issue. Here’s how to specify Parquet as the read format:"

    "Managing file sizes is an important factor not so much for writing data but reading it later on. When you’re writing lots of small files, there’s a significant metadata overhead that you incur managing all of those files. Spark especially does not do well with small files, although many file systems (like HDFS) don’t handle lots of small files well, either. You might hear this referred to as the “small file problem.” The opposite is also true: you don’t want files that are too large either, because it becomes inefficient to have to read entire blocks of data when you need only a few rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark 2.2 introduced a new method for controlling file sizes in a more automatic way. We saw previously that the number of output files is a derivative of the number of partitions we had at write time (and the partitioning columns we selected). Now, you can take advantage of another tool in order to limit output file sizes so that you can target an optimum file size. You can use the *maxRecordsPerFile* option and specify a number of your choosing. This allows you to better control file sizes by controlling the number of records that are written to each file. For example, if you set an option for a writer as `df.write.option(\"maxRecordsPerFile\", 5000)`, Spark will ensure that files will contain at most 5,000 records."
