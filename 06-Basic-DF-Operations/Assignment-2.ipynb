For this example, we need to specify the schema explicitly since not all the columns will be converted the way we would like to by the default option.\n\nAs a reminder, here is how we can define a schema containing two columns, one string, and one integer:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import StructField, StructType, StringType, LongType\n\nmyManualSchema = StructType([\n  StructField(\"ID\", LongType(), True),\n  StructField(\"name\", StringType(), True)\n])\n\ndf = spark.read.csv(path = data + \"gs/path/to/file\", \n                    header=True, quote='\"', \n                    schema=myManualSchema)\n```\n\nModify this code to load athlete_events.csv. Call this DataFrame `athlete_events`:\n\n**Note 1:** We have \"NA\" values in our data. This could cause issues when loading the data. To overcome this we need to let Spark know that what string is representing `null` in the data. We can use the option/parameter `nullValue` and set it to \"NA\". You will need to modify the code snippet to adjust for this.\n\n**Note 2:** When working with CSV files, you might encounter text fields containing commas. These commas can pose a challenge, as the parser might mistakenly interpret them as delimiters, leading to incorrect cell separation. To circumvent this issue, it's standard practice to enclose such text fields in quotes, as shown in the previous code snippet ('\"'). However, this approach presents a new challenge when the text itself contains quote characters, potentially confusing the parser. To resolve this, we can employ the `escape='\"'` option. This setting allows the inclusion of quote characters within a text field without prematurely terminating it. For our `athlete` file, it's crucial to apply this adjustment to ensure accurate parsing. You'll need to modify the provided code snippet accordingly to account for these considerations."}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 33, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": "# Your answer goes here\n"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "Print the schema of this DataFrame:"}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 23, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [{"name": "stdout", "output_type": "stream", "text": "root\n |-- ID: long (nullable = true)\n |-- Name: string (nullable = true)\n |-- Sex: string (nullable = true)\n |-- Age: long (nullable = true)\n |-- Height: long (nullable = true)\n |-- Weight: long (nullable = true)\n |-- Team: string (nullable = true)\n |-- NOC: string (nullable = true)\n |-- Games: string (nullable = true)\n |-- Year: long (nullable = true)\n |-- Season: string (nullable = true)\n |-- City: string (nullable = true)\n |-- Sport: string (nullable = true)\n |-- Event: string (nullable = true)\n |-- Medal: string (nullable = true)\n\n"}], "source": "# Your answer goes here\n"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "Print the first 5 rows:"}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 24, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [{"name": "stdout", "output_type": "stream", "text": "+---+--------------------+---+---+------+------+--------------+---+-----------+----+------+---------+-------------+--------------------+-----+\n| ID|                Name|Sex|Age|Height|Weight|          Team|NOC|      Games|Year|Season|     City|        Sport|               Event|Medal|\n+---+--------------------+---+---+------+------+--------------+---+-----------+----+------+---------+-------------+--------------------+-----+\n|  1|           A Dijiang|  M| 24|   180|    80|         China|CHN|1992 Summer|1992|Summer|Barcelona|   Basketball|Basketball Men's ...| null|\n|  2|            A Lamusi|  M| 23|   170|    60|         China|CHN|2012 Summer|2012|Summer|   London|         Judo|Judo Men's Extra-...| null|\n|  3| Gunnar Nielsen Aaby|  M| 24|  null|  null|       Denmark|DEN|1920 Summer|1920|Summer|Antwerpen|     Football|Football Men's Fo...| null|\n|  4|Edgar Lindenau Aabye|  M| 34|  null|  null|Denmark/Sweden|DEN|1900 Summer|1900|Summer|    Paris|   Tug-Of-War|Tug-Of-War Men's ...| Gold|\n|  5|Christine Jacoba ...|  F| 21|   185|    82|   Netherlands|NED|1988 Winter|1988|Winter|  Calgary|Speed Skating|Speed Skating Wom...| null|\n+---+--------------------+---+---+------+------+--------------+---+-----------+----+------+---------+-------------+--------------------+-----+\nonly showing top 5 rows\n\n"}], "source": "# Your answer goes here\n"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "Load noc_regions.csv.
