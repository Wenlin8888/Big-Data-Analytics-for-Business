In order to obtain a meaningful result from a machine learning algorithm a thorough preprocessing is required. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s particularly complicated programming, but rather that it requires deep knowledge of the data you are working with and an understanding of what your model needs in order to successfully leverage this data.\n\nFeature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine learning, and is both difficult and expensive.\n\n## Formatting Models According to Your Use Case\n\nTo preprocess data for Spark\u2019s different advanced analytics tools, you must consider your end objective.

Transformers are functions that accept a DataFrame as an argument and return a new DataFrame as a response. This notebook will focus on what transformers are relevant for particular use cases rather than attempting to enumerate every possible transformer.\n\nSpark provides a number of transformers that can be found under *pyspark.ml.feature*. For more information on transformers you can visit [Extracting, transforming and selecting features doccumentation page](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html).\n\nTransformers are functions that convert raw data in some way. This might be to create a new interaction variable (from two other variables), to normalize a column, or to simply turn it into a Double to be input into a model. Transformers are primarily used in preprocessing or feature generation. RFormula that we saw in the previous lecture is an example of a transformer.\n\nSpark\u2019s transformer only includes a transform method. This is because it will not change based on the input data. Figure below is a simple illustration. On the left is an input DataFrame with the column to be manipulated. On the right is the input DataFrame with a new column representing the output transformation.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/soltaniehha/Big-Data-Analytics-for-Business/blob/master/figs/10-01-A-Spark-transformer.png?raw=true\" width=\"800\" align=\"center\"/>\n\nThe **`Tokenizer`** is an example of a transformer. It tokenizes a string (converts the input string to lowercase and then splits it by white spaces) and has nothing to learn from our data; it simply applies a function.

An estimator is necessary when a transformation you would like to perform must be initialized with data or information about the input column (often derived by doing a pass over the input column itself). For example, if you wanted to scale the values in our column to have mean zero and unit variance, you would need to perform a pass over the entire data in order to calculate the values you would use to normalize the data to mean zero and unit variance. In effect, an estimator can be a transformer configured according to your particular input data. In simplest terms, you can either blindly apply a transformation (a \u201cregular\u201d transformer type) or perform a transformation based on your data (an estimator type). Figure below is a simple illustration of an estimator fitting to a particular input dataset, generating a transformer that is then applied to the input dataset to append a new column (of the transformed data).\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/soltaniehha/Big-Data-Analytics-for-Business/blob/master/figs/10-01-A-Spark-estimator.png?raw=true\" width=\"800\" align=\"center\"/>\n"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "An example of this type of estimator is the **`StandardScaler`**, which scales your input column according to the range of values in that column to have a zero mean and a variance of 1 in each dimension.

There are some defaults (you can find these in the documentation), but it is a best practice to manually specify them yourself for clarity. In addition to input and output columns, all transformers have different parameters that you can tune (whenever we mention a parameter in this chapter you must set it with a set() method). In Python, we also have another method to set these values with keyword arguments to the object\u2019s constructor. Estimators require you to fit the transformer to your particular dataset and then call transform on the resulting object."}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "## High-Level Transformers\n\nHigh-level transformers, such as the RFormula we saw in the previous lecture, allow you to concisely specify a number of transformations in one. These operate at a \u201chigh level\u201d, and allow you to avoid doing data manipulations or transformations one by one. In general, **you should try to use the highest level transformers you can, in order to minimize the risk of error and help you focus on the business problem instead of the smaller details of implementation**. While this is not always possible, it\u2019s a good objective.\n\n### RFormula\n\nThe **`RFormula`** is the easiest transfomer to use when you have \u201cconventionally\u201d formatted data. Spark borrows this transformer from the R language to make it simple to declaratively specify a set of transformations for your data. With this transformer, values can be either numerical or categorical and you do not need to extract values from strings or manipulate them in any way. The RFormula will automatically handle categorical inputs (specified as strings) by performing something called one-hot encoding. In brief, one-hot encoding converts a set of values into a set of binary columns specifying whether or not the data point has each particular value (we\u2019ll discuss one-hot encoding in more depth later in the notebook). With the RFormula, numeric columns will be cast to Double but will not be one-hot encoded. If the label column is of type String, it will be first transformed to Double with StringIndexer.\n\nThe RFormula allows you to specify your transformations in declarative syntax. It is simple to use once you understand the syntax. Currently, RFormula supports a limited subset of the R operators that in practice work quite well for simple transformations. The basic operators are:\n\n~\nSeparate target and terms\n\n+\nConcat terms; \u201c+ 0\u201d means removing the intercept (this means that the y-intercept of the line that we will fit will be 0)\n\n-\nRemove a term; \u201c- 1\u201d means removing the intercept (this means that the y-intercept of the line that we will fit will be 0\u2014yes, this does the same thing as \u201c+ 0\u201d\n\n:\nInteraction (multiplication for numeric values, or binarized categorical values)\n\n.\nAll columns except the target/dependent variable\n\nRFormula also uses default columns of label and features to label, you guessed it, the label and the set of features that it outputs (for supervised machine learning). The models covered later on in this chapter by default require those column names, making it easy to pass the resulting transformed DataFrame into a model for training.\n\nLet\u2019s use RFormula in an example. In this case, we want to use all available variables (the .) and then specify an interaction between value1 and color and value2 and color as additional features to generate:"}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 9, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [{"name": "stdout", "output_type": "stream", "text": "+-----+----+------+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+\n|color|lab |value1|value2            |features                                                            |label|\n+-----+----+------+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+\n|green|good|1     |14.386294994851129|(10,[1,2,3,5,8],[1.0,1.0,14.386294994851129,1.0,14.386294994851129])|1.0  |\n|blue |bad |8     |14.386294994851129|(10,[2,3,6,9],[8.0,14.386294994851129,8.0,14.386294994851129])      |0.0  |\n+-----+----+------+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+\nonly showing top 2 rows\n\n"}], "source": "from pyspark.ml.feature import RFormula\n\nsupervised = RFormula(formula=\"lab ~ . + color:value1 + color:value2\")\nsupervised.fit(simpleDF).transform(simpleDF).show(2, False)"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "### SQL Transformers\n\nA **`SQLTransformer`** allows you to leverage Spark\u2019s vast library of SQL-related manipulations just as you would a MLlib transformation. Any SELECT statement you can use in SQL is a valid transformation. The only thing you need to change is that instead of using the table name, you should just use the keyword \\__THIS__. You might want to use SQLTransformer if you want to formally codify some DataFrame manipulation as a preprocessing step, or try different SQL expressions for features during hyperparameter tuning. Also note that the output of this transformation will be appended as a column to the output DataFrame.\n\nYou might want to use an SQLTransformer in order to represent all of your manipulations on the very rawest form of your data so you can version different variations of manipulations as transformers.

This will split a given continuous feature into the buckets of your designation. You specify how buckets should be created via an array or list of Double values. This is useful because you may want to simplify the features in your dataset or simplify their representations for interpretation later on. For example, imagine you have a column that represents a patient\u2019s BMI and you would like to predict some value based on this information. In some cases, it might be simpler to create three buckets of \u201coverweight,\u201d \u201caverage,\u201d and \u201cunderweight.\u201d\n\nTo specify the bucket, set its borders. For example, setting splits to 5.0, 10.0, 250.0 on our contDF will actually fail because we don\u2019t cover all possible input ranges. When specifying your bucket points, the values you pass into splits must satisfy three requirements:\n\n* The minimum value in your splits array must be less than the minimum value in your DataFrame.\n\n* The maximum value in your splits array must be greater than the maximum value in your DataFrame.\n\n* You need to specify at a minimum three values in the splits array, which creates two buckets.\n\nTo cover all possible ranges we can use `float(\"inf\")` and `float(\"-inf\")`.\n\nIn order to handle null or NaN values, we must specify the `handleInvalid` parameter as a certain value.

For instance, the 90th quantile is the point in your data at which 90% of the data is below that value. You can control how finely the buckets should be split by setting the relative error for the approximate quantiles calculation using `setRelativeError`. Spark does this is by allowing you to specify the number of buckets you would like out of the data and it will split up your data accordingly. The following is an example:"}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 14, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [{"name": "stdout", "output_type": "stream", "text": "+----+---------+\n|  id|id_bucket|\n+----+---------+\n| 0.0|      0.0|\n| 1.0|      0.0|\n| 2.0|      0.0|\n| 3.0|      1.0|\n| 4.0|      1.0|\n| 5.0|      1.0|\n| 6.0|      1.0|\n| 7.0|      2.0|\n| 8.0|      2.0|\n| 9.0|      2.0|\n|10.0|      2.0|\n|11.0|      3.0|\n|12.0|      3.0|\n|13.0|      3.0|\n|14.0|      3.0|\n|15.0|      4.0|\n|16.0|      4.0|\n|17.0|      4.0|\n|18.0|      4.0|\n|19.0|      4.0|\n+----+---------+\n\n"}], "source": "from pyspark.ml.feature import QuantileDiscretizer\n\nbucketer = QuantileDiscretizer(numBuckets=5, inputCol=\"id\", outputCol=\"id_bucket\")\nfittedBucketer = bucketer.fit(contDF)\nfittedBucketer.transform(contDF).show()"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "**NOTE:** If the user chooses to keep NaN values, they will be handled specially and placed into their own bucket, for example, if 4 buckets are used, then non-NaN data will be put into buckets[0-3], but NaNs will be counted in a special bucket[4]."}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "### Scaling and Normalization\n\nWe saw how we can use bucketing to create groups out of continuous variables. Another common task is to scale and normalize continuous data. While not always necessary, doing so is usually a best practice. You might want to do this when your data contains a number of columns based on different scales. For instance, say we have a DataFrame with two columns: weight (in ounces) and height (in feet). If you don\u2019t scale or normalize, the algorithm will be less sensitive to variations in height because height values in feet are much lower than weight values in ounces. That\u2019s an example where you should scale your data.\n\nAn example of normalization might involve transforming the data so that each point\u2019s value is a representation of its distance from the mean of that column. Using the same example from before, we might want to know how far a given individual\u2019s height is from the mean height. Many algorithms assume that their input data is normalized.\n\nAs you might imagine, there are a multitude of algorithms we can apply to our data to scale or normalize it. Enumerating them all is unnecessary here because they are covered in many other texts and machine learning libraries. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the concept in detail, check out any of the books referenced in the previous lecture. Just keep in mind the fundamental goal\u2014we want our data on the same scale so that values can easily be compared to one another in a sensible way. \n\n**`StandardScaler`**\n\nThe `StandardScaler` standardizes a set of features to have zero mean and a standard deviation of 1. The flag `withStd` will scale the data to unit standard deviation while the flag `withMean` (false by default) will center the data prior to scaling it.\n\nWARNING: Centering can be very expensive on sparse vectors because it generally turns them into dense vectors, so be careful before centering your data.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of using a `StandardScaler`:"}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 15, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [{"name": "stdout", "output_type": "stream", "text": "+---+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+\n|id |features      |StandardScaler_e86082788ebb__output                           |\n+---+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+\n|0  |[1.0,0.1,-1.0]|[-0.9561828874675149,-0.5610294986546213,-0.9561828874675149] |\n|1  |[2.0,1.1,1.0] |[0.23904572186687867,-0.32726720754852906,0.23904572186687872]|\n|0  |[1.0,0.1,-1.0]|[-0.9561828874675149,-0.5610294986546213,-0.9561828874675149] |\n|1  |[2.0,1.1,1.0] |[0.23904572186687867,-0.32726720754852906,0.23904572186687872]|\n|1  |[3.0,10.1,3.0]|[1.4342743312012722,1.7765934124063008,1.4342743312012722]    |\n+---+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n"}], "source": "from pyspark.ml.feature import StandardScaler\n\nsScaler = StandardScaler(inputCol=\"features\", withMean=True)\nsScaler.fit(scaleDF).transform(scaleDF).show(5, False)"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "**`MINMAXSCALER`**\n\nThe `MinMaxScaler` will scale the values in a vector (component wise) to the proportional values on a scale from a given min value to a max value.

Indexing converts a categorical variable in a column to a numerical one that you can plug into machine learning algorithms.

This can be helpful in maintaining your models over the long run as your encoding practices may change over time.\n\n**`StringIndexer`** \n\nThe simplest way to index is via the StringIndexer, which maps strings to different numerical IDs.

To avoid this, we use `OneHotEncoder`, which will convert each distinct value to a Boolean flag (1 or 0) as a component in a vector.
